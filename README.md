This project is a web page with semantic and rubber layout for usability and accessibility. To improve user experience, the project utilizes MixItUp plugins for filtering and sorting content, and Fancybox for creating modal windows. Icons-links have accessibility for users, and smooth transitions to different sections of the page are implemented.
